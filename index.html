  <!-- About -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Sharena, a junior at TAEHS and a passionate aspiring game and UI/UX designer. I passed my certifications for Web Dev, like the HTML/CSS, and am on track to complete the C++ Certification. I love blending art, storytelling, and interactivity to create experiences that educate, inspire, and connect with people. Whether I’m coding in JavaScript or designing in Canva and Figma, I’m always looking for creative ways to bring ideas to life with polish and purpose.</p>

  <section id="competitions">
    <h2>🏆 Competitions</h2>
    <p><strong>🌼 NatureNourish – Games for Change (G4C) Student Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>This game was submitted to G4C under the theme <em>Protecting the Environment</em>. I wanted players to experience the joy and responsibility of healing nature through simple actions like catching trash and growing flowers. It was my first time creating an environmental game, and it pushed me to think about impact, design, and storytelling all at once.</p>

    <p><strong>🎨 MentalSpark – InfyApp Challenge (Infosys Foundation)</strong></p>
    <p>MentalSpark was our team’s entry for the InfyApp Challenge. Our goal was to address mental health awareness and accessibility. I led the visual direction and helped build a compassionate, clean, and helpful interface for users. We created Figma prototypes, branding materials, and app slides that combined purpose with beautiful design.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- MentalSpark Section -->
  <section id="mentalspark">
    <h2>🧠 MentalSpark: Graphic Design Journey</h2>
    <p>In the MentalSpark group project—our submission for the <strong>InfyApp Challenge</strong>—I was the lead graphic designer. Designing and creating truly brings me joy — watching an idea grow from nothing into something amazing is fascinating. I designed the logo, layout themes, and visual interface for our app and slide deck. My role helped shape the personality and tone of the project from a visual perspective.</p>
    <p>I’m known for being detail-oriented and love refining even the smallest design elements to create clarity and consistency. I’ve always had a strong appreciation for aesthetics and precision. Being able to bring that to a social impact project like MentalSpark made it even more meaningful.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy business and public speaking — I love presenting ideas and making my presence known among my peers. This experience confirmed my desire to pursue a career in UI/UX design or a related creative tech field after high school.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Reflection -->
  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>📝 Final Reflection</h2>
    <p>Through this project and portfolio, I’ve grown as a creative problem-solver and storyteller. I’ve learned how to plan, test, and reflect on feedback, and I’ve strengthened both my coding and design skills. NatureNourish helped me grow my programming confidence, while MentalSpark showed me how powerful visuals can shape user emotions.</p>
    <p>I’m excited to keep building experiences that feel personal, helpful, and beautiful. Thank you for reviewing my work!</p>
